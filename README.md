KAction - a port of [SwiftCommunity/Action](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/Action)
======


An **KAction** is a way to say "hey, later I'll need you to subscribe to this thing." It's actually a lot more involved than that.

KActions accept a `workFactory`: a closure that takes some input and produces an observable. When `execute()` is called, it passes its parameter to this closure and subscribes to the work.

- Can only be executed while "enabled" (`true` if unspecified).
- Only execute one thing at a time.
- Aggregates next/error events across individual executions.

Oh, and it has this really nice thing with `Button` that's pretty cool. It'll manage the button's enabled state, make sure the button is disabled while your work is being done, all that stuff üëç

_Works perfectly with [RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding)_

Usage
-----

You have to pass a `workFactory` that takes input and returns an `Observable`. This represents some work that needs to be accomplished. Whenever you call `execute()`, you pass in input that's fed to the work factory. The `Action` will subscribe to the observable and emit the `Next` events on its `elements` property. If the observable errors, the error is sent as a `Next` even on the `errors` property. Neat.

Actions can only execute one thing at a time. If you try to execute an action that's currently executing, you'll get an error. The `executing` property sends `true` and `false` values as `Next` events.

```kotlin
val kaction = KAction<String, Boolean>(input, {
    networkLibrary.checkEmailExists(input)
})
...
kaction.execute("ash@ashfurrow.com")
```

Notice that the first generic parameter is the type of the input, and the second is the type of observable that `workFactory` creates. You can think of it a bit like the action's "output."

You can also specify an `enabledIf` parameter to the `KAction` initializer.
 
```kotlin
val isEmailValid: Observable<Boolean> = RxTextView.textChanges(emailTextView).map(this::isValidEmail())

val kaction = KAction<String, Boolean>(input, {
    networkLibrary.checkEmailExists(input)
}, isEmailValid)
```

Now `execute()` only does the work if the email address is valid. Super cool!

Note that `enabledIf` isn't the same as the `enabled` property. You pass in `enabledIf` and the action uses that, and its current executing state, to determine if it's currently enabled.

What's _really_ cool is the `Button` can be bound to the enabled state.

```kotlin
// The button executes the action 
button.setOnClickListener { kaction.execute(input) }

// But the enabled state is dependent on the action's state
kaction.enabled.subscribe { button.isEnabled = it }
```

Now when the button is pressed, the action is executed. The button's `enabled` state is bound to the action's `enabled` property. That means you can feed your form-validation logic into the action as a signal, and your button's enabled state is handled for you. Also, the user can't press the button again before the action is done executing, since it only handles one thing at a time. Cool.
